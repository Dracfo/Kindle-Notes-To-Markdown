# Kindle Notes to Markdown Converter
This program is designed to take in raw kindle notes (the 'My Clippings.txt file') from a Kindle device and output a formatted markdown file to go into an Obsidian Vault.

The program assumes that the notes file is in the same folder as the program itself and that the notes file is called 'My Clippings.txt'.

This application was created because I didn't have an easy way to copy notes from my Kindle device to my Obsidian Zettelkasten Vault. If the ebook is purchased through Amazon, it is easy to export the notes, however, not all the ebooks I read are purchased through Amazon. That means that the only way to get access to the notes was by manually searching through the file of all the notes I have ever created on the device to find the notes for the book I want to export. Which is way too much work, especially if you read more than one book at a time. Thus the idea for a program that could easily scan throguh the entire document, pick out the related notes, and 

The program can also be used to search through all your notes for any keyword(s). The process is the exact same, just add the keyword(s) you are looking for where you would normally write the title of the book (Usage: python kindletomd.py {Keyword(s)}).
